The AI agent here is a robot that has to replace a flat tyre with a spare one. This involves fetching the tools (wrench, jack, pump) from the boot, undoing the nuts on the flat tyre, jacking up the (appropriate) hub(s), removing the tyre, doing up the spare one, etc. Note that there is no restriction on how many objects the AI agent (i.e., the robot) can carry. Also note that each hub has only one nut.
