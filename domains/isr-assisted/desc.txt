An independent set of a graph is a subset of its vertices such that no two vertices of the subset share an edge. Reconfiguring an independent set means replacing one vertex in the subset with another one such that the new subset is still an independent set. The ISR problem is to find a sequence of such reconfiguration steps to reach a given target configuration from a given start configuration. Model the reconfiguration with two actions, "remove" and "add". "remove" cannot be taken if the last action taken was a "remove" action, and conversly "add" can only be taken if the last action taken was a "remove".
