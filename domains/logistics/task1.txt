Currently I've got five packages to ship, 3 in a storage in Ado and the rest in Betar's storage. Those from Ado should be sent 1 to Bal Street in Betar, 2 to Cli Promenade in Colin. Those from Betar should be moved to the Ado storage. The only plane is currently in Duran's airport, but each city has it's own truck and airport.
